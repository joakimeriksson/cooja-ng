# Changelog

All notable changes to Cooja-NG (`csim`) are documented here. The format is
loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/); this project
uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) once it reaches 1.0 — until
then, 0.x minor releases may adjust the CLI, config, and plugin ABI.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-06-19

First public release. A fast, multi-architecture C re-implementation of the
parts of Cooja and MSPSim needed to run the upstream Contiki-NG test suite
headlessly, with a focus on simulation speed, deterministic timing, and
faithful peripheral behaviour.

### Emulation
- **MSP430 / MSP430X** CPU (computed-goto interpreter + optional GNU Lightning
  JIT), MCU configs F149 / F1611 / F2617 / F5437 / CC430F5137 / FR5969, with
  GPIO, USART/eUSCI, Timer A/B, BCS/UCS/CS clocks, ELF loader, and the CC2420
  radio.
- **ARM Cortex-M3/M4/M33** interpreter (Thumb-2 + M4 DSP/VFP) with CC2538
  (on-chip RF Core), Zolertia Firefly (+ CC1200 sub-GHz), and Nordic nRF52840 /
  nRF54L15 (on-chip 802.15.4) platforms.
- **Native Cooja motes** (`dlopen`) and **JS app motes** (QuickJS).

### Simulation kernel
- Single-threaded, event-driven kernel (`sim_runtime_t`): ns-precise clock,
  unified `(time, seq)` event queue, per-radio multi-channel medium, per-byte
  RF delivery, and a Cooja-compatible execution model.
- **Ports-and-adapters architecture**: CPUs, radio chips, propagation policies,
  observation features, and plugins are adapters behind small vtable ports; the
  kernel never branches on a concrete node type.
- Pluggable **radio medium** policy (UDGM / NONE / plugin), and **power-aware
  range** matching Cooja UDGM (range scales with the transmitter's output
  power; byte-identical for firmware that holds max PA).

### Plugins
- `dlopen` plugin ABI (`csim_plugin.h`), additive/version-gated:
  v1 register a service, v2 register a radio medium, v3 draw a live web-UI panel
  (`publish_panel`).
- Plugins may also be **compiled in** as built-in services and selected by
  config name (`"plugins": ["energest"]`), Cooja's built-in-plugin style.
- Bundled examples: `packet_sink` (service `.so`), `lossy_medium` (medium
  `.so`), and **energest** — a compiled-in energy estimator (per-mote radio
  duty cycle + CPU/LPM/TX/LISTEN energy, with a live UI panel).

### Tooling & tests
- JSON simulation configs (v1 + v2), a live WebSocket UI, PCAP capture,
  activity timeline, per-mote GDB stub, and a JS/JSON test engine.
- Passes the upstream Contiki-NG Cooja test suite (**89 / 89**, including the
  TUN/border-router cases) via `tools/run-cooja-tests.sh`, plus instruction,
  firmware, radio-medium/bus, chip-driver, and plugin unit suites.
- CI on Linux (gcc) and macOS (clang).

### Known limitations
See [README "Known issues"](README.md#known-issues). Notably: a default
circular topology with many nodes (`-n 16`) does not converge (one collision
domain, not a regression); the Firefly sub-GHz chain has an ACK-turnaround
residual after sustained traffic; native host-process scheduling is a
documented deferral; the energest ARM CPU current is MSP430-class (indicative).
